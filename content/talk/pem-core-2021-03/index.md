title: "PEM Board Review: Dental Emergencies"
abstract: "A board review conference with practice questions followed by an expert discussion. For the board questions, I followed a modified team-based learning format where faculty and fellows answer questions individually, then discuss in small breakout groups and commit to an answer. We then review the correct answers as a large group, focusing on questions with disagreement."
