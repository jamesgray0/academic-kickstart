As a chief resident, in collaboration with my co-chiefs and program director, we developed an educational curriculum based on American Board of Pediatrics content specification, resident needs, and faculty requests. We covered all major pediatric subspecialities, coached faculty on how to deliver effective talks, developed small-group sessions, and coordinated with outside speakers.
