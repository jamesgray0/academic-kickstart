As chief fellow for education, in conjunction with program leadership, we moved all conferences to a virtual or hybrid format, collaborated with faculty, fellows, staff, and other division to maximize engagement during the COVID pandemic. We also created a novel online feedback form for the tracking of fellow educational competencies. We developed and implemented a web-based shared conference planning and tracking application to improve communication and quality of online conferences.
